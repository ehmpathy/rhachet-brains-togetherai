## Head-to-Head: Inference Cost (per 1M tokens)

> **note:** rates vary by provider. together ai serverless rates are higher than cheapest-provider rates.

| Model | Together AI (in/out) | Cheapest provider (in/out) | Cached Input | Context |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Qwen3-Coder-Next** | **$0.50 / $1.20** | **$0.07 / $0.30** (chutes) | — | 262K |
| **Grok Code Fast 1** | n/a (xai only) | $0.20 / $1.50 | $0.02 | 256K |
| **DeepSeek V3.1** | $0.60 / $1.70 | $0.28 / $0.42 (deepseek.com, v3.2) | $0.028 | 128K |
| Claude Sonnet 5 | n/a | $3.00 / $15.00 | — | — |
| GPT-5.2 | n/a | $1.25 / $10.00 | — | — |

### Real-World Cost Implications

Grok Code Fast 1 is **verbose** (3.8x more output tokens than average). Adjusted for verbosity:

| Model | Effective cost per typical task (together ai) | Effective cost (cheapest provider) |
|---|---|---|
| **Qwen3-Coder-Next** | Moderate | Lowest (chutes $0.07/$0.30) |
| **DeepSeek V3.1** | Moderate | Low (deepseek.com, with cache) |
| **Grok Code Fast 1** | Moderate-High (xai) | n/a |
| Claude Sonnet 5 | Highest | Highest |

## The Verdict

### Grok Code Fast 1 vs Qwen3-Coder-Next

| | Grok Code Fast 1 | Qwen3-Coder-Next (together ai) | Qwen3-Coder-Next (chutes) |
|---|---|---|---|
| SWE-Bench | 70.8% | 74.2% | 74.2% |
| Input $/1M | $0.20 | $0.50 (2.5x more) | **$0.07** (3x cheaper) |
| Output $/1M | $1.50 | **$1.20** (1.25x cheaper) | **$0.30** (5x cheaper) |
| Active params | 314B MoE | **3B** | **3B** |
| Fine-tunable | No | **Yes** ($6/1M tokens) | No (inference only) |
| Context | 256K | **262K** | **262K** |

**On together ai:** Qwen3-Coder-Next surpasses Grok on accuracy (+3.4 points) with cheaper output, but input is 2.5x more expensive. The value prop is fine-tune access + better accuracy, not raw cost.

**On chutes:** Qwen3-Coder-Next beats Grok on accuracy AND cost (5x cheaper output), but no fine-tune access.

### Grok Code Fast 1 vs DeepSeek V3.1 (Together AI) / V3.2 (deepseek.com)

| | Grok Code Fast 1 | DeepSeek V3.1 (together ai) | DeepSeek V3.2 (deepseek.com) |
|---|---|---|---|
| SWE-Bench | 70.8% | — | **73.0%** |
| Input $/1M | $0.20 | $0.60 | $0.28 ($0.028 cached) |
| Output $/1M | $1.50 | $1.70 | **$0.42** (3.6x cheaper) |
| Fine-tunable | No | **Yes** ($10/1M) | No (inference only) |
| Context | **256K** | 128K | 128K |

**DeepSeek V3.2 beats Grok on accuracy (+2.2 points) and output cost via deepseek.com, but is not yet on together ai.** V3.1 is available on together ai with fine-tune access but at higher rates than grok.

## Strategic Summary

1. **Grok Code Fast 1 is popular but not the best value.** Its 57.6% OpenRouter market share is driven by speed and xAI's $25 free credits + $150/mo data-share credits — not raw cost-performance.

2. **Provider matters for cost comparison.** Qwen3-Coder-Next is $0.07/$0.30 on chutes but $0.50/$1.20 on together ai. The "43x cheaper than claude" claim only holds at cheapest-provider rates, not together ai rates. On together ai, it's ~6x cheaper on input.

3. **Together AI's premium buys fine-tune access.** The higher inference rates on together ai come with access to LoRA fine-tune ($6/1M tokens for qwen3-coder). Cheap providers like chutes offer inference only — no fine-tune.

4. **Qwen3-Coder-Next now surpasses Grok.** Updated swe-bench score is 74.2% vs Grok's 70.8% — a +3.4 point lead. Combined with fine-tune access, it's a stronger choice for agentic code tasks.

5. **Grok's real advantage:** Speed (~283 tok/s), large context (256K), aggressive cache ($0.02/1M), and generous free credits for rapid iteration. Good for high-throughput, latency-sensitive agentic loops.

6. **GLM-5 (77.8% swe-bench) just released.** MIT license. May shift the landscape further when together ai rates are published.

7. **None of these touch Claude/Codex on raw accuracy** (~80-82%), but the gap has narrowed to ~5 points with glm-5. Fine-tune on the open-source options could close it further — an option Grok doesn't offer.
