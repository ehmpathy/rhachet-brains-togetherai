wish =

we wish to support togetherai as a new brain suppiler

together-ai has a philosophy that aligns really well with rhachet 

it also supplies an inference api against many of the top language brains and supports the ability to finetune as well

these are huge advantages


some are even cheaper and competitive in performance with closed source providers like qwen3-coder-next vs grok/code-fast-1

---

so, we want to use the xai template from this repo

and replace all of it with one that runs against together-ai and exposes the top frontier brains from together-ai, with full brain specs and etc


we need to update everything in this repo

- readme
- package.json
- src
- tests
- briefs


basically, all mention of brains-xai should be replaced with brains-togetherai 

that way, we can leverage these cheap and powereful opensource brains 

fund the opensource vision

and leverage cheaper + variant intelligence

at the same time
